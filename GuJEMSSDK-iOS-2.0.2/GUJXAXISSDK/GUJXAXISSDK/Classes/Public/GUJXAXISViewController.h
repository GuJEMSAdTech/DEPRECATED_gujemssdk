 * The GUJXAXISViewController extends the ORMMAViewController and
 * adds all necessary functionality to enable XAXIS Video Ads
 *
 * If an ad server response contains an smartstream tag which holds
 * the required xaxsis publisher-id, the sdk will serve the XAXSIS Video Ad.
 *
 * XAXSIS delegate calls are translated to GUJAdViewDelegate calls and piped
 * thru the implementing application.
 *
 * All iOS Versions above 3.x are supported.
